# fish-wars

A mod to make Skywars a little less violent. Teamed with an ok map, you'll be, uh, slapping people with fish...
So basically, imagine you're playing Skywars, but instead of a diamond sword, you're holding cod. That's what this mod is.
---
And now, a list of all the fish that work:
- Floppy Cod
- Sturdy Cod
- Inflaty Pufferfish
---
Fish that are in the works:
- Hilarious clownfish
- Water Blaster Salmon
- Healing Squid
---

It's intended to be a nonviolent version of Skywars that your parents should be happy to let you play. Please open a bug if your parents disapprove of any element of this.
This mod was developed with bridge., a free mod creating editing program. [This](https://www.bridge-core.app) is their website, and their repository is [here](https://github.com/bridge-core/bridge.).
For model, texture, and animation editing, I used a tool called [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net), which is easy to use.
